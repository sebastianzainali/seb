        The project aims to explore the efficient simultaneous production of electricity and food on the same land through extensive collaboration with representatives from academia, business, and the public sector. While tests from other countries have shown positive results, specific knowledge is needed for the application of agrivoltaics in the Skåne region. The plan involves designing and constructing a physical test facility in Skåne to practically investigate and demonstrate the effective combination of agriculture and solar power under local conditions.
A key component of the project is to demonstrate, generate, and disseminate knowledge to business promoters and, subsequently, to companies in both the energy and food sectors. This will include suggestions on resolving the conflict between food production and solar power generation on Skåne farmland. The primary goal of the project is to showcase and assess the efficient implementation of agrivoltaics in the Skåne region.

        Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments. Love is not love
        Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove.
        O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
        It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come;
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
        If this be error and upon me proved,
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

        Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
